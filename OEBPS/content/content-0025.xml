Human nature easily falls off from its good affections, on account of the frailty and evil inclinations of the flesh, which depress the soul, and draw her always downwards, unless she often raises herself upwards by continual efforts: just like birds, which will fall to the ground if they do not keep their wings constantly in motion, so as to sustain their flight. For this reason, Philothea, you must repeat very often the good resolutions you have made to serve God, lest, by neglecting to do so, you should relapse into your former state, or even into a worse condition; for spiritual falls always cast us down to a lower state than that in which we were before we aspired to devotion.</p>

This exercise will repair your spirit, impaired by time, warm your heart, reani mate your good resolutions, and make your virtues flourish vigorously.</span></p>

Let us also, Philothea, seriously dispose ourselves to follow their example. Having, then, for this purpose, chosen the most convenient time, according to the advice of your spiritual father, for a retreat of a few days, meditate on the following points, according to the method I have prescribed in the second part.</p>

<a id="GBS.PA263.w.3.1.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" id="para.286.3.1.box.62.1070.756.264.q.101" style="font-size:102%;text-indent:1em;">Consider the points of your protestation :--First, to have forsaken, cast away, detested, and renounced for ever all mortal sin; secondly, to have dedicated and consecrated your soul, heart, and body, with all their powers and faculties, to the love and service of God; thirdly, that if you should chance to fall into any sin, you would immediately rise again by the help of God's grace. Are not these just, noble, and<a id="GBS.PA264.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.287.1.0.box.113.156.754.100.q.101">
generous resolutions? Consider well in your soul, therefore, how holy and reasonable this protestation is, and how much it is to be desired.</span></p>

Consider to whom you have made this protestation; for it is to God. If our word given to men bind us strictly, how much more so those we have given to God "It is to Thee, O Lord," said David, "my heart hath spoken it, my heart hath sent forth this good word. Oh! I will never forgetit." (Ps. xliv.)</p>

Consider that you made this protestation in the presence of the whole court of heaven. Yes, your patron saint and all that blessed company beheld you, and their breasts heaved with emotions of joy and exultation at your words: they saw, with the eyes of unspeakable love, your heart prostrate at the feet of your Saviour, consecrating itself to his service. As there was a particular joy on that occasion in the heavenly Jerusalem, so there will be now a commemoration of the same, if with a sincere heart you renew your resolutions.</p>
<a id="GBS.PA264.w.1.3.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" id="para.287.1.3.box.116.802.757.416.q.101" style="font-size:101%;text-indent:1em;">4. Consider by what means you were induced to make your protestation. Ah! how good and gracious was God to you at that time? Oh, tell me sincerely were you not invited to it by the sweet attractions of the Holy Ghost? Were not the ropes wherewith God drew your boat to that blessed haven composed of love and charity? How earnestly did He seek to attract you thereto by the delicious sweetness of his grace in the sacraments, spiritual reading, and prayer. Alas! Philothea, you were asleep whilst God watched: He thought over your soul thoughts of peace, and meditated in your favour meditations of love.</p>
<a id="GBS.PA264.w.1.4.0"></a><p class="gtxt_body" id="para.287.1.4.box.120.1222.754.132.q.101" style="text-indent:1em;">5. Consider that God inspired you with these holy resolutions in the flower of your age. Ah! what a happiness it is to learn so soon that which we cannot know but too late. St. Augustin, having<a id="GBS.PA265.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.288.1.0.box.82.151.752.550.q.101">
been called at the age of thirty years, exclaimed: "O ancient beauty! how comes it that I have known thee so late? Alas! I saw thee before, but considered thee not:" and you may well say, O ancient sweetness! why did I not relish thee before? Alas! you did not even then deserve it. However, acknowledging the special favour which God has done you in attracting you to Himself in your youth, say, with David: "Thou hast taught me, O my God, from my youth, and I will for ever declare thy wonderful works." (Ps. xvii. 47.) But if this has happened in your old age, ah! Philothea, what an extraordinary grace, that, after having thus misspent all your former years, God should call you before your death, and stop the course of your misery at a time in which, if it had continued, you must have been miserable for eternity.</span></p>

Consider the effects of this vocation, and comparing what you now are with what you have been, you will doubtless find in yourself a great change for the better. Do you not esteem it a happiness to know how to converse with God by prayer; to be inflamed with a desire to love Him; to have obtained a complete victory over the many passions wherewith you were troubled; to have avoided innumerable sins and perplexities of conscience; and, in fine, to have communicated so much oftener than you would have done, uniting yourself to that sovereign source of never-ending grace? Ah, how great are these favours! We must weigh them, Philothea, with the weights of the sanctuary; it is God's right hand that has done all this: "The right hand of the Lord," says David, "hath exalted me; I shall not die, but live, and shall declare with my heart, with my mouth, and by my actions, the wonderful works of the Lord."

Neither is it expedient that you should perform it on your knees, except at the beginning and the end, which comprises the affections. The other points of the examination you may perform profitably whilst walking abroad, or still more profitably in bed, provided you can preserve yourself against drowsiness, and keep thoroughly awake: but then, to do this, you must have read attentively beforehand. It is necessary, however, to go through the whole of the second point in three days and two nights at furthest, dedicating as much time to it on each day and night as you possibly can; for if this exercise should be deferred to times far distant from each other, it would lose its force and make but weak impressions.</p>

You must also in the daytime make frequent aspirations to God, to our Lady, to the angels, and to the whole court of heaven: moreover, all this must be done with a heart fully inflamed with the love of God, and a desire of attaining perfection.</p>

Place yourself in the presence of God. 2. Invoke the Holy Ghost, begging of Him to enlighten your understanding, that you may gain a perfect knowledge of yourself, crying out with St. Augustin, in the spirit of humility: "O Lord, let me know Thee, and let me know myself;" and with St. Francis: “Lord, who art Thou, and who am I?" Protest that it is not your intention to acquire this knowledge in order to attribute any glory to yourself on the occasion, but that you may rejoice in God: return Him thanks, and glorify his blessed name for all his benefits. Protest, likewise, that if you find, as you fear you shall, that you have made but little or no progress, or even that you have gone backward, be not, nevertheless, by any means dejected, chilled, or overcome by any sort of cowardice or faintheartedness; but, on the contrary, encourage and animate yourself, humble yourself the more, and apply, with the assistance of divine grace, the proper remedies to your defects.

Nothing keeps her heart from him; she gives up all other thoughts, in order to think on him alone. It is the same with souls that love God well; be they ever so busy, when the remembrance of God comes near them, they lose almost the thought of all things else, for joy to see that this dear remembrance is returned; and this is an extremely good sign.</p>

As bees are pleased with their honey, and wasps with corrupted things, so good souls find their contentment in thinking on Jesus Christ, and feel great love for Him; but the wicked take delight in vanities.</p>

Do you love them well? Have you a special confidence in their patronage? Are you pleased with their representations, their lives, and their praises?</p>

For it is only the inordinate love of ourselves that will be our ruin. Now, a well-ordered love requires that we should love the soul better than the body; that we should be more solicitous to acquire virtue than any other thing; that we should set a higher estimation on the favour of heaven than on the honour of this low and perishable world.

It is no great humility in a fly to esteem itself nothing in comparison with a mountain; nor for a drop of water to hold itself as nothing in comparison with the sea; nor for a spark of fire to hold itself as nothing when compared with the sun; but humility consists in not esteeming ourselves above others, and in not desiring to be so esteemed by others.

cau make your soul content in this world. Behold how beautiful they are, and draw a comparison between the virtues and their contrary vices. What sweetness in patience, when compared with revenge? In meekness, compared with anger and vexation. In humility. compared with arrogance and ambition? In liberality, compared with covetousness. In charity in comparison with envy? In sobriety, with revellings? For virtues have this admirable quality. that they delight the soul with an incomparable sweetness and satisfaction after we have exercised them whereas vices leave the soul exceedingly fatigued and disordered. Why then do we not endeavour to acquire this sweetnees?</span></p>

But above all, behold that innumerable train of fair and delicate virgins, whiter than lilies in purity, sweeter than roses in charity; some of whom at twelve, others at thirteen, fifteen, twenty, and twenty-five years of age, have endured a thousand kinds of martyrdom, rather than renounce their resolutions, not only in regard to the profession of their faith, but also their protestation of devotion; some dying rather than forsake their virginity; others, rather than desist from consoling their companions-in-torture, comforting the afflicted, and burying the dead.

How invincible have they shown themselves in their resolutions, from which nothing could ever divert them; how they embraced them without reserve, and maintained them without exception. Good God! what admirable things does St. Augustin relate of his holy mother, with what constancy did she pursue her design of serving God, both in marriage and widowhood; and St. Jerome also of his dear daughter, Paula, in the midst of so many oppositions, in the midst of such a variety of accidents! What is there that we might not do after such excellent patterns? They were what we are; they served the same God, and practised the same virtues; why should not we also do as much, according to our condition and vocation, in order to preserve our resolution, and the holy protestations we have made to belong to God.</p>

By all these pains and sufferings He obtained of God the Father the good resolutions and protestations which your heart has made; and by the same means He also obtained for you whatever is necessary to maintain, nourish, strengthen, and fulfil them. O holy resolutions, how precious are ye, since ye are the fruits of the passion of my Saviour! Oh, how tenderly ought my soul cherish ye, having been so dear to my sweet Jesus! Alas! O Saviour of my soul, Thou didst die to purchase for me these resolutions, Oh, grant me thy grace rather to suffer death than to lose them. Observe, Philothea, that it is certain that the Heart of Jesus beheld your heart from the tree of the cross, and by the love which He bore it, obtained for you all the good you ever had or shall ever have. Yes, Philothea, we may all say with the prophet Jeremias: "O Lord, before I had a being, Thou didst behold me, and didst call me by my name;" since the divine goodness did actually prepare for us all the general and particular means of our salvation, and consequently of our resolutions. As a woman before the birth of her infant prepares the cradle, the linen, the swathing clothes, and even a nurse for it, although it is not yet in the world, so our Saviour, who designed to bring you forth to salvation, and make you his child, prepared on his cross all that was necessary for you-your spiritual cradle, your linen, your swathing clothes, and your<a id="GBS.PA279.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.302.1.0.box.72.136.749.100.q.101">

It is impossible that I could have been so tenderly beloved by my Saviour, as that He could think of me in particular, even in all those little occurrences by which He has drawn me to Himself! How much then ought we to love, cherish, and employ all that to our profit! O consoling reflection ! the tender heart of Jesus thought on Philothea, loved her, and procured for her a thousand means of salvation, even as many as if it had no other soul in the world to think on. As the sun, shining upon one place of the earth, enlightens it no less than if it shone on no other, so, in the very same manner, is our Lord solicitous for all his dear children, thinking on each of them as if there was no other in the world. "He loved me, and gave Himself up for me," says St. Paul, speaking as of himself alone, and as if Jesus had done nothing for others. O Philothea, let this sacred truth be engraved on your soul, in order to cherish and nourish your resolution, which was so precious to the heart of your Saviour.</p>

I have no longer anything of me or mine; it is Jesus who lives in me, and all that I can call mine is to be wholly his. O world, thou art always thyself, and I have hitherto been always myself; but from henceforth I will be myself no more. No, we shall be no more ourselves, for we shall have our hearts changed, and the world which has O often deceived us shall be deceived in us; for not perceiving our change but by little and little, it will think that we are still Esaus, but we shall be like unto Jacob.</p>

Alas! Philothea, even should we do nothing else, we should do enough, since we should do all that we ought to do in this world. But do you not perceive the stratagem of our enemy? If they were all to be necessarily performed every day, they would then indeed be our whole occupation; but it is not requisite to perform them otherwise than in their proper time and place, as occasions inay present themselves. Of the full code of the civil laws, how many ought to be observed? The number must be determined according to circumstances, and no one would contend that all should be practised every day. David was a king occupied with the most difficult affairs, yet he performed many more exercises than I have prescribed to you. St. Louis, a prince admirable in war, peace, and the administration of justice, heard two Masses every day, and said vespers and complin with his chaplain; also made his meditations, visited hospitals every Friday, confessed frequently, and wore haircloth; heard sermons frequently, and held very often spiritual conferences: yet with all this he never met a single occasion for promoting the public good, which he did not lay hold of and diligently put in execution; and his court was more splendid and flourishing than it ever had been in the time of his predecessors. Perform, then, these exercises as I have marked out for you, and God will give you sufficient leisure and strength to perform all the rest of your affairs, even though He should make the sun stand still for you, as He did for Josue. We always do enough when God works with us.</p>

I have thus presupposed, and it is no less true that everyone has it not; but it is also true that almost everyone, even the most dull, may have it, provided they have good guides, and are willing to take as much pains to obtain it as it deserves. But even should there be some who have not this gift in the smallest degree, which I think can hardly be the case, a wise spiritual director will easily supply the defect, by teaching them to read, or to hear others read, the considerations included in the meditations, with profound and close attention.</p>

When you feel any disorder in your soul, take your protestation in hand, and, prostrate in the spirit of humility, recite it with your whole heart; this will cause you to feel great ease and comfort.</p>

Besides it cuts short many proposals and invitations which the world might make to draw us the contrary way, and obliges us in honour to act according to what we profess. As philosophers profess themselves philosophers that they may be allowed to live like philosophers, so we must profess that we are desirous of devotion, that we may be allowed to live devoutly. If anyone tell you that you may live devoutly without the practice of these counsels and exercises, answer him mildly that, your infirmity being so great, you stand in need of more help and assistance than others.</p>

Our days glide away and death is at the gate: "The trumpet sounds the retreat," says St. Gregory Nazianzen, "let every man be ready, for judgment is near." St. Symphorian's mother, seeing him led to martyrdom, cried after him: "My son, remember eternal life; look up to heaven, and think upon Him who reigns there; you are approaching quickly the termination of this short course of earthly life." Philothea, I say the same to you: look up to heaven and do not forfeit it for this base earth! look down to hell, and do not cast yourself into it for transitory toys! look up to Jesus Christ, and do not renounce Him for the world!<a id="GBS.PA286.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.309.1.0.box.106.175.745.70.q.101">
