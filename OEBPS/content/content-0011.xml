and pens of his servants, that, although the doctrine is always one and the same, the discourses which are held on it are, nevertheless, very different, according to the various methods in which they are composed. I certainly cannot, neither do I wish, nor ought I to write in this Introduction but what has been written by our predecessors on this subject. They are the same flowers which I present to you, my reader; but the bouquet which I have formed from them will be different from theirs, on account of the difference of the method of making it.</span></p>

This, it is true, is a difficult task, and therefore I could wish that many would endeavour to accomplish it with more ardour than has been hitherto used; and I, weak as I am, shall endeavour by this treatise to contribute some kind of help to those who, with a generous heart, undertake so worthy an enterprise.</span></p>

I readily acquiesced, from a conviction that his judgment was superior to mine, and because his friendship had great power over my will.</span></p>

But all this I have done, having scarcely any leisure; for which reason you will find nothing in this treatise exact or in order, but only a heap of good admonitions, delivered in plain and intelligible words, without my having bestowed as much as a thought on the ornaments of language, having business of more consequence on my hands.</p>

aspire to devotion; for the Greek word, Philothen, signifies a soul loving, or in love with, God. Regarding, then, throughout this work, a soul which, by the desire of devotion, aspires to the love of God, I have divided it into five parts. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">first</span>, I endeavour, by remonstrances and exercises, to convert the simple desire of Philothea into an absolute resolution, which she at last makes, by a firm protestation, after her general confession, followed by the most Holy Communion; in which, giving herself up to her Saviour, she happily enters into his holy love. Then, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">second </span>part, I try to lead her farther on; I show her the two great means whereby she may unite herself more and more to his Divine Majesty, viz., the use of the sacraments, whereby God comes to us, and holy prayer, by which He attracts us to Himself In the <span style="font-style:italic;">third</span>, I show her how she ought to exercise herself in the virtues most proper for her advance-ment; not stopping, except at some particular advices, which she could hardly have received elsewhere, or discovered herself. In the fourth <span style="font-style:italic;">part</span>, I expose some of the ambushes of her enemies to her view, showing her how she may escape them, and proceed forward in her laudable undertaking. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">fifth</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">last</span>, I make her retire a</span><a id="GBS.PR10.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.13.1.0.box.107.167.753.127.q.101">

But I say to thee, dear reader, with the great St. Denis, that it belongs principally to bishops to conduct souls to perfection, since their order is as supreme among men as that of the seraphim is among the angels; so that their leisure cannot be better employed. The ancient bishops and fathers of the Church, it must be granted, were at least as careful of their charge as we are; yet they did not decline to superintend the particular conduct of several souls who had recourse to their assistance, as appears by their epistles; in this they imitated the apostles, who, amidst the general harvest of the world, picked up certain remarkable ears of corn with a special and particular affection. Who is ignorant that Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Onesimus, St. Thecla,<a id="GBS.PR11.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.14.1.0.box.80.166.761.306.q.101">
and Appia, were the dear pupils of the great St. Paul; as St. Mark and St. Petronilla were of St. Peter?-St. Petronilla, I say, who, as Baronius and Galonius learnedly prove, was not St. Peter's real, but only his spiritual daughter. And does not St. John write one of his canonical epistles to the devout Lady Electa?</span></p>

It is a labour which refreshes and revives the heart, by the sweet de lights it brings to those that are engaged therein; as the cinnamon does to those that carry it through Arabia Felix. It is said that when the tigress finds one of her whelps, which the huntsman leaves in her way to amuse her, whilst he carries off the rest of the litter, she loads herself with it, be it ever so big, and yet does not feel herself more heavy, but rather lighter in the course she makes to leave it safe in her den, natural love making her burden more easy: how much more willingly, then, will a fatherly heart take charge of a soul in which he has found a desire for holy perfection; carrying it<a id="GBS.PR12.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.15.1.0.box.80.164.758.262.q.101">

For as a great and learned man has said: "To study is a good way to learn; to hear, is a still better; but to teach, is the best of all." "It often happens," said St. Augustin, writing to the devout Florentina, "that the office of distributing gives us the merit of receiving; and that the office of teaching serves as a foundation for learning." Alexander caused the picture of the fair Campaspé to be drawn by the hand of the celebrated Apelles, who, being forced to look upon her for a considerable time together, as fast as he drew her features in his picture the love of them became insensibly imprinted in his heart, which, coming to the knowledge of Alexander, he, taking pity on him, gave her to him in marriage, depriving himself, for his sake, of the<a id="GBS.PR13.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.16.1.0.box.92.169.756.173.q.101">

Now, if ever the Divine Majesty shall see me passionately in love with it, He will give it to me in an eternal marriage. The fair and chaste Rebecca, watering Isaac's camels, was destined to be his wife, and received, on his part, golden ear-rings and bracelets. Thus do I flatter myself, through the infinite goodness of God, that, in conducting his dear sheep to the wholesome waters of devotion, He will make my soul his spouse, putting in my ears the golden words of his holy love, and on my arms the strength to practise good works, in which consists the essence of true devotion; which I humbly beseech his Majesty to grant to me and to all the<a id="GBS.PR14.w.1.0.0"></a><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.17.1.0.box.78.166.764.127.q.101">
