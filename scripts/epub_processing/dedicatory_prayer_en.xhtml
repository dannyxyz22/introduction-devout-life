    <h1>DEDICATORY PRAYER</h1>
    
    <div class="prayer">
      <p>O SWEET JESUS, my Lord, my Saviour, and my God, behold me here prostrate before thy majesty, devoting and consecrating this book to thy glory; give life to its words by thy blessing, that those souls for which I have written it, may receive from it the sacred inspirations which I desire for them. And particularly that of imploring for me thy immense mercy; to the end that, whilst showing others the way of devotion in this world, I may not myself be eternally rejected and confounded in the other; but that, with them, I may for ever sing, as a canticle of triumph, the words which, with my whole heart I pronounce, in testimony of my fidelity amidst the dangers of this mortal life: LIVE JESUS, LIVE JESUS; yea, <em>Lord</em> Jesus, live and reign in our hearts for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
